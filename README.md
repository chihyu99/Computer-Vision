## Project 5: Panoramic View
* a fully automated approach for robust homography estimation and subsequently refine it using Nonlinear Least-Squares minimization approaches such as Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm
* The RANdom SAmpling Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is first used for outlier rejection and the linear least squares algorithm is used to obtain initial homography estimates. The subsequent LM-based refinement provides a more robust homography estimate.
